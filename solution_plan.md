# Proposed Solution

Lets calculate a MATCH SCORE, between all school and highest score will win the match making.

# How to calculate MATCH SCORE:
We can discuss on that: 

- As we have velthuis and school name in two different file, I have done, character matching between two name (english and nepali) and calculated the score. (Implementation: calculate_similarity)

- Lets not stop on name, lets do same thing on district and other fields and calculated a weighted MATCH SCORE between school


# Result
highest_scores.csv


# Need Help On
- Generating velthuis for the district1 col of file school_list_A.tsv
